# PyHandy

PyHandy is a simple library for handling basic IO operations in Python.

## Requirements for Running

PyHandy has been developed using Python 3.7. It's recommended that you use at least that while running. However, it'll
probably work with other versions of Python 3.

If you don't have Python 3.7, or you'd like to be able to manage multiple Python environments you might consider taking
a look at using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

A `requirements.txt` has been provided to help with setting up your development environment.
